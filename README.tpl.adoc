== Contribution
You host a blog on https://ipfs.io[IPFS] or know of a decentralized blog missing here? Feel free to add it to `ipfs-blogs.csv`!

The table is generated from the `ipfs-blogs.csv` file. If you want to add a new blog to the table, you need to update the `ipfs-blogs.csv` file. 

Threfore you need to run `build.py` to update the table. But that's not required for sending a pull request. If you don't run the build script it will be executed by someone else.
